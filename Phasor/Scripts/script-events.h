/*! \namespace scripting::events
* \brief All script events are raised through functions here.
*
*	All scripting events receive at least one parameter, this parameter
*	determines whether or not your return value will be considered.
*	It is the last parameter on all functions and you don't need to explicitly
*	add it to your parameter list unless you want to use it.
*
*	### CHANGES
*		- If you don't want your return value to be considered you \b must either
*		  return \c nil or return nothing at all.
*		- If you return a value and \c relevant == \c false it will be ignored.
*		- The value indicating the server is executing the command is \c nil not \c -1
*		- OnClientUpdate only receives the player's memory id, not their object id.
*		- OnPlayerJoin only receives the player's memory id, not their team too.
*		- OnWeaponAssignment should return the \c id on the desired weapon, it shouldn't
*		  returned the result of \c lookuptag, instead use \c gettagid. Also, for
*		  performance reasons scripts should save the result of \c gettagid instead
*		  of calling it each time.
*		- OnDamageLookup has completely changed, you shouldn't write to its
*		  \c tagdata anymore. Instead, use the odl_ functions to modify its
*		  behaviour.
