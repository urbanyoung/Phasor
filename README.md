Phasor (Wizard Mod)
======

Welcome to my phasor mod. Stuff on here will be general fixes that oxide couldn't be bothered with.

Fixes/Additions:
  - Added getplayerobject, getplayerweaponid, getplayerweapon, getplayervehicleid, and getplayervehicle as Lua functions.
  - OnVehicleEject now called when exitvehicle() is called.
  - No longer says 'script already loaded' in scriptlogs.
  - OnObjectCreationAttempt now passes the player argument (instead of the parent player).
  - Added setlead() and setdefaultlead() that will be used when phasor gets its nolead.
  - All Halo structures updated to have all the same variables as my address page here: http://pastebin.com/z4eqrjVN
